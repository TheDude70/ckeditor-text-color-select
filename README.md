CKEditor 5 Text Color Selector
==============================================

The Text Color Selector to add color to your text within Ckeditor 5.

## Documentation

The available colors in this plugin are all the named css colors available. It also includes an upcast which I require in a personal project where it finds the closest available color. It should be straight forward to modify this for your own needs.

This is a use as is or modify as you require plugin. I will update or modify as I require for personal projects. Requests for options/features you may require for your projects will mostly be ignored. You are free to fork and modify as you see fit.

First, install the build from npm:

```bash
npm install --save ckeditor-text-color-select
