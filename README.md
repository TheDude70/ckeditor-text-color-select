CKEditor 5 Text Color Selector
==============================================

The Text Color Selector to add color to your text within Ckeditor 5.

## Documentation

The available colors in this plugin are all the named css colors available. It also includes an upcast which I require in a personal project where it finds the closest available color. It should be straight forward to modify this for your own needs.

## Quick start

First, install the build from npm:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon
```

Use it in your JavaScript application:

```js
import TextColor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon';

```
